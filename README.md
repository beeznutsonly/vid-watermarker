# vid watermarker

Given there seem to be no tools which offer: 1. a dedicated video watermarking service, which can 2. batch-watermark videos and, 3. do it free of charge; I decided to make my own script to do just that for the videos I upload to [r/romanticxxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanticxxx) upon learning that the vlc media player has built-in tools for that kind of use case.

As I mentioned, the script uses the vlc media player's transcoding feature, which can allow you to overlay marquee text or a picture logo on top of your videos. Those who'd like to use this program should have both python and the latest version of the vlc media player installed.
